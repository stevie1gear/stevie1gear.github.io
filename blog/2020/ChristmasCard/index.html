Ok, maybe I procrastinated a little bit.</p> <p>As with many others, time this year has seemed to go slower than ever and yet looking back at the year, it seems like Memorial Day only just happened. I began biking for exercise this year and to stay sane through the isolation. Originally training to complete the Denver Century Ride, I switched to training to bike up Pikes Peak once it became clear that the coronavirus would end all group activities this year. Pikes Peak is the eastern most 14,000+ foot mountain (14er) in the continental United States and one of six that I summited this year. A peak only 33 miles and 8000 feet vertically from my apartment, needless to say the descent was much more enjoyable than the ascent.</p> <p>Along with biking, I was able to enjoy a variety of hiking this year. Pictured on the card is one of my first hikes of the year, the famed Manitou Incline at sunrise. I was fortunate enough to hike with my family in Vermont while, as many others experienced this year, working remotely. I also explored many new trails out here in Colorado. I discovered the tree cover is a lot less than back in New England causing many sunburns early on. It took some time until I made it part of my routine before hiking, and to remember to reapply in the middle of some hikes.</p> <p>I am fortunate to have so much family here in Colorado. One highlight with family was my brother picking me up in a Cessna and flying me back to Denver for a fun weekend. A much more preferable way of getting to Denver than driving on the stretch of I-25 from Colorado Springs. I was also able to spend time with my cousins and their families. I was very happy to join them for gluten free pizza nights, which surprisingly tastes better than you think.</p> <p>Work this year has required a lot of patience at times as I have worked in a variety of roles and different programs. I am happy where I have landed though and am hoping to stay on this program for a while which makes this my first Christmas letter where I do not tell you about an upcoming move to another state.</p> <p>As the new year fast approaches, I need to remind myself that things will likely stay the same for much of the beginning of 2021 as we wait for the vaccine to be widely available. What I am hopeful for and will be working towards in 2021, is that the year ends better than it started.</p> <p>Best wishes,<br> Steven</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2022 Steven J Maloney. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.6/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-EdPgYcPk/IIrw7FYeuJQexva49pVRZNmt3LculEr7zM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
