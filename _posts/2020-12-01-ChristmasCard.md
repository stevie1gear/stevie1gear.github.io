Dear Family and Friends,

I do apologize if this letter comes late in the holiday season, although I will blame that entirely on the slowing of the USPS and definitely not my procrastination in writing this letter.  Ok, maybe I procrastinated a little bit.

As with many others, time this year has seemed to go slower than ever and yet looking back at the year, it seems like Memorial Day only just happened.  I began biking for exercise this year and to stay sane through the isolation.  Originally training to complete the Denver Century Ride, I switched to training to bike up Pikes Peak once it became clear that the coronavirus would end all group activities this year.  Pikes Peak is the eastern most 14,000+ foot mountain (14er) in the continental United States and one of six that I summited this year.  A peak only 33 miles and 8000 feet vertically from my apartment, needless to say the descent was much more enjoyable than the ascent.

Along with biking, I was able to enjoy a variety of hiking this year.  Pictured on the card is one of my first hikes of the year, the famed Manitou Incline at sunrise.  I was fortunate enough to hike with my family in Vermont while, as many others experienced this year, working remotely.  I also explored many new trails out here in Colorado.  I discovered the tree cover is a lot less than back in New England causing many sunburns early on.  It took some time until I made it part of my routine before hiking, and to remember to reapply in the middle of some hikes.

I am fortunate to have so much family here in Colorado.  One highlight with family was my brother picking me up in a Cessna and flying me back to Denver for a fun weekend. A much more preferable way of getting to Denver than driving on the stretch of I-25 from Colorado Springs.  I was also able to spend time with my cousins and their families.  I was very happy to join them for gluten free pizza nights, which surprisingly tastes better than you think.

Work this year has required a lot of patience at times as I have worked in a variety of roles and different programs.  I am happy where I have landed though and am hoping to stay on this program for a while which makes this my first Christmas letter where I do not tell you about an upcoming move to another state.

As the new year fast approaches, I need to remind myself that things will likely stay the same for much of the beginning of 2021 as we wait for the vaccine to be widely available.  What I am hopeful for and will be working towards in 2021, is that the year ends better than it started.

Best wishes,\\
Steven
