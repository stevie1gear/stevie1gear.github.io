Dear Family and Friends,

I put off writing this letter for way too long, like many of my assignments for grad school (update one in my life: I started grad school at Georgia Tech).  Hopefully next year I will be more on top of my life (don’t hold your breath).

I can’t believe it has already been a year since my last card, I have moved between three states, graduated college, and started a full time job, or as one of my aunt’s would say, I have become a productive member of society.  I spent most of 2019 in Baltimore, MD;  A place too far south to be part of the Northeast and also too far north to be part of the South.  

Moving to a new city with no family or friends nearby made for a lonely start to the year, but that quickly changed when I started sailing.  I was invited to deliver Artemis II for a race down the bay and for some reason was invited back aboard the following week to race, and then again and again.  Sailing started out as a one night a week activity and in no time I found myself spending four or five nights a week on the water.  I highly recommend that anyone coming to visit Baltimore set aside some time to enjoy Baltimore from the water.  

I moved down here this past February for work and have enjoyed the challenge that it has provided me.  Moving into ASIC design was a natural transition from spending the previous summer in a semiconductor foundry.  That being said, I am so grateful for the guidance from people in my department because there was still plenty I needed to learn.  Just as I started this year moving to a new state for work, this coming year I am excited to be moving to Colorado Springs to start a new position within Northrop Grumman.

The membership to the Downtown Sailing Center and the friends I met through it changed my view on the city.  Baltimore went from a place I couldn’t wait to move onto the next place from to a place that I am sad to say goodbye to.  As I look back at this past year I am reminded at what I said in last year’s christmas card and how this year has only reinforced it, friends are met in unique places at unexpected times.  So, family and friends, new and old, please keep in touch, and please come out to visit me in Colorado Springs!

I wish you happiness and health this holiday season and for the new year.

Best,\\
Steven

P.S. I love seeing where my cards end up (last year they traveled a total of 47254 miles) so please if you have a chance to snap a selfie or take a picture of wherever you put Christmas cards send it my way.
