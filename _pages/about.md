I am an engineer that graduated from Boston University College of Engineering with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. If you meet me in person, feel free to stop me and ask to see my mini diploma, I carry it in my wallet.

I am currently working on my Masters of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning at The Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing, which compliments my work as an AI Software Engineer.

When I am not behind a computer, I like to bike, hike, sail, and run.  I enjoy in person hockey games, typically college hockey. I am hoping this site inspires me to write more.
